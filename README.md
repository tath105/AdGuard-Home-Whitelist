## Intro ✍

This is a strict, curated whitelist for [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) with a focus on enforcing privacy and security.

It also helps avoid ads, trackers and malware, and blocks tracking and telemetry whenever possible, by default.

__It's a great starting point for people who wish to run AdGuard Home in a strict whitelisting manner.__

ℹ Please learn [AdGuard Home's interface](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki) before using this list.
